THINGS TO LEARN:
basic understanding of machine learning
how to put ROS onto my pico. I might be able to find projects like that on github. 

ADVANCED:
-Design a new robot with a specific purpose, model it in sim, fabricate parts, assemble it, and make it work. Might need a 3d printer? print parts? 
Maybe not a bad idea to focus on simulated robots? get good at simulation and coding? Then when you have more resources you can do things IRL.

-two cameras so that AI can learn depth perception

-procedurally generated training world for navigating a road with obstacles, walking stairs or uneven terrain, jumping over uneven gaps at uneven heights.

RESOURCES:

NEXT STEPS:
put on github
make an AI model in which elgooso learns to avoid obstacles. objective: get to the end. reward pos x distance traveled. punish cumulative -x distance traveled. punish collisions. allow control of right wheel pair, left wheel pair, servo, sensor. write model into ros.
